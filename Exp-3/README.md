# Experiment 3: React SPA with Responsive Design

This experiment demonstrates building a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite with responsive CSS styling and modern UI/UX design patterns.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:

1. **Build Responsive Web Interfaces** - Create responsive designs that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.

2. **Implement Modern CSS Techniques** - Apply advanced CSS features including gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, backdrop filters, and smooth animations for enhanced user experiences.

3. **Develop React Components** - Design and structure reusable React functional components with proper JSX syntax for building scalable single-page applications.

4. **Master Client-Side Routing** - Implement React Router for navigation between different pages (Home, About, Contact) without full page reloads using `react-router-dom`.

5. **Create Interactive UI Elements** - Build interactive form components, buttons with hover effects, and animations that provide visual feedback and improve user engagement.

## Experiment Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize a React + Vite project
- Install required dependencies including `react-router-dom`
- Configure the project structure with organized component folders

### Step 2: Create Route Components
- Built three main page components:
  - `Home.jsx` - Landing page with call-to-action button
  - `About.jsx` - Company information with card component
  - `Contact.jsx` - Contact form with input fields
- Structured each component with semantic HTML and proper accessibility

### Step 3: Implement Base Styling
- Created `App.css` with a common styling framework
- Established color schemes for each page using gradient backgrounds
- Set up base typography and spacing variables

### Step 4: Apply Modern CSS Effects
- **Gradients**: Used linear gradients (purple, pink, cyan) for each page
- **Animations**: Implemented fade-in and slide-up animations on page load
- **Glassmorphism**: Added frosted glass effect to the About page info card
- **Hover Effects**: Created smooth transitions and transform effects on interactive elements
- **Shadows & Depth**: Applied box-shadows for visual hierarchy and depth

### Step 5: Make Design Responsive
- Implemented media queries for three breakpoints:
  - **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full-featured layout with enhanced animations
  - **Tablet (768px-1024px)**: Optimized spacing and font sizes
  - **Mobile (480px-768px)**: Adjusted padding and full-width elements
  - **Small Mobile (360px-480px)**: Further optimized for tiny screens
- Tested and verified layout integrity across all breakpoints

## Key Features Implemented

- ✨ Smooth fade-in animations on page load
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient backgrounds per page
- 💎 Glassmorphism design patterns
- 🔄 Interactive form with styled inputs
- 📱 Fully responsive across all devices
- ⌨️ Accessible focus states for form elements
- 🖱️ Smooth hover effects and transitions

## Technologies Used

- **React** - UI component library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **CSS3** - Advanced styling with gradients, animations, and media queries
